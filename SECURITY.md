3. **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability (if applicable)
5. **Suggested Fix**: Any suggestions for fixing the vulnerability (optional)
6. **Your Contact Information**: Email address for follow-up communication

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: We will provide a detailed response within 7 days, including an assessment and expected timeline for a fix
- **Resolution**: We aim to release a fix for critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We request that you give us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before any public disclosure
- We will work with you to understand and address the issue
- We will credit you for the discovery when we publicly disclose the vulnerability (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Update Process

When a security vulnerability is confirmed:

1. We will develop a fix
2. We will release a security update
3. We will publish a security advisory
4. We will notify affected users

### Scope

The following are considered in scope for security reports:

- Authentication and authorization issues
- Data exposure vulnerabilities
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, etc.)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Remote code execution
- Cryptographic weaknesses

### Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope:

- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Denial of service attacks
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (please report these to the respective maintainers)
- Issues that require unlikely user interaction
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of exploitability

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service interruption
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission from the account holder
- Do not exploit a security issue for any purpose other than verifying the vulnerability

### Recognition

We maintain a hall of fame for security researchers who have responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities to us. If you would like to be included (or excluded), please let us know when reporting the vulnerability.
